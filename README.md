# Gaia

This is the source code repository for the app that connects to the plant sensor. This app is written using the app framework flutter, which allows us to build the app both for iOS and Android.

In order to get started developing, install [nix](https://nix.dev) and run `nix develop` (and have some patience while it downloads java, required android components and loose bits and bobs).
